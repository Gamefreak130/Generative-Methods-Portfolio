My goal for this assignment was to tie in everything I had learned over the quarter in some way or another. In that sense, I think I was successful; although my work on the mask itself was minimal and largely taken from example code, I was able to include a simple Tracery grammar, an array of floats (kind of), and a natural text input that I think interprets responses in an interesting and unique way.

## A Mosaic of Emotion

Feelings are complicated. When we say we're feeling "good" or "angry" or "anxious," that's almost never the end of the story: all sorts of attitudes, goals, obstacles, and personality traits are intertwining at any given moment to produce the emotional states we experience. Sometimes we will broadcast these feelings and their underpinnings to the world, while other times we merely wear a mask to conceal them.

Type in how you're feeling and hit enter to generate a reflection of these layers of emotion -- or perhaps to discover another mask to wear. Generally, the more detailed you are, the better the mosaic will turn out.

## Sliders

There are six sliders, whose labels will change based on the input you typed in. In order, they are:

1. Zoom -- Self-explanatory
2. Mask Lerp -- Effectively, how large each cell of the Voronoi mask is. The lower the value, the sparser the canvas will look.
3. Trails -- Controls the opacity of the background layer drawn each frame. Lower values create a dreamlike trail effect.
4. Mask Hue -- Adjusts the hue of each cell of the Voronoi mask.
4. Mask Saturation -- Adjusts the saturation of each cell of the Voronoi mask.
4. Mask Lightness -- Adjusts the lightness of each cell of the Voronoi mask.
