## A Mosaic of Emotion

Feelings are complicated. When we say we're feeling "good" or "angry" or "anxious," that's almost never the end of the story: all sorts of attitudes, goals, obstacles, and personality traits are intertwining at any given moment to produce the emotional states we experience. Sometimes we will broadcast these feelings and their underpinnings to the world, while other times we merely wear a mask to conceal them.

Type in how you're feeling and hit enter to generate a reflection of these layers of emotion -- or perhaps to discover another mask to wear. Generally, the more detailed you are, the better the mosaic will turn out.
