## Weird Pets

A chatbot to simulate taking care of some bizarre non-human companions. These aren't your everyday cats or dogs; they're...much weirder.

### Caring for Your Weird Pet

1. Type in the kind of weird pet you'd like to raise. The bot will comment on your choice (or its unavailability, as the case may be).

2. Enter the name you'd like your pet to have. A descriptive adjective will be generated in order to form the pet's full name (e.g. "Jackson the Skittish Dog").

3. Your pet may experience a wide range of emotions. Enter commands (e.g. "pet," "feed corn flakes," "brush with an elegant toothbrush") in order to (try to) keep them happy and healthy.

If you're feeling lazy, you can type "Surprise Me" or click the "Surprise Me" button at any time to generate a random species, name, or action. You can also type "New Pet" or click the "New Pet" button at any time to find a new companion.
