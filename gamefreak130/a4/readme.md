## Busybodies

Busybodies believe that there is always work to be done, and simply cannot sit still. They are always on the lookout for a new project to work on, but also require copious amounts of coffee to keep themselves focused at all hours of the day.

Busybodies are social creatures, and will tend to pick up whatever their friends are doing so they can work (or drink coffee) together.

## Coffee and Homework

These objects are scattered across the area by means of the Winds of Productivity. If you'd like, you can play the role of professor or barista and add some more yourself.

## Lazybones

Lazybones are the antithesis of everything Busybodies stand for. They avoid all work and caffeine, prefering instead to get together and engage in all-day gaming marathons.

Lazybones find the high-strung Busybodies irritating, and will stay away from them. Likewise, Busybodies cannot stand anyone who does not share their philosophy of workaholism, and will avoid Lazybones like the plague.
