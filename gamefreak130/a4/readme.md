## Busybodies

Busybodies believe that there is always work to be done, and simply cannot sit still. They are always on the lookout for a new project to work on, but also require copious amounts of coffee to keep themselves focused at all hours of the day.

Busybodies are social creatures, and will tend to pick up whatever their friends are doing so they can work (or drink coffee) together.

## Coffee and Homework

These objects are scattered across the area by means of the Winds of Productivity. If you'd like, you can play the role of professor or barista and add some more yourself.

## Lazybones

Lazybones are the antithesis of everything Busybodies stand for. They avoid all work and caffeine, prefering instead to get together and engage in all-day gaming marathons.

Lazybones find the high-strung Busybodies irritating, and will stay away from them. Likewise, Busybodies cannot stand anyone who does not share their philosophy of workaholism, and will avoid Lazybones like the plague.

## UI Controls

There are four drawing tools, six actions, and five sliders. Only one drawing tool can be active at a time.

### Drawing Tools

* ‚òï -- Click anywhere in the scene to place a cup of coffee for Busybodies to grab and Lazybones to avoid.

* üìÑ -- Click anywhere in the scene to place a homework assignment for Busybodies to grab and Lazybones to avoid.

* üë®‚Äçüíº -- Click anywhere in the scene to place a new Busybody.

* üéÆ -- Click anywhere in the scene to place a new Lazybone.

### Actions

* "Pause" -- Stops or resumes the simulation

* "Show/Hide Clock" -- Toggles the simulation clock used for day/night cycling in the upper-left corner

* "Show/Hide Lightmap" -- Toggles a particle lightmap in the upper-right corner

* "Object Debug" -- Toggles a map of the Winds of Productivity

* "Busybody Debug" -- Toggles a view of the forces driving each Busybody

* "Lazybones Debug" -- Toggles a view of the forces driving each Lazybone

### Sliders

* "BusybodyCohesion" -- Controls how tightly packed together the Busybodies will try to be

* "LazybonesCohesion" -- Controls how tightly packed together the Lazybones will try to be

* "CoffeeAttraction" -- Controls how strongly a Busybody will be driven towards picking up a cup of coffee

* "HomeworkAttraction" -- Controls how strongly a Busybody will be driven towards picking up a homework assignment

* "Drag" -- Controls the drag applied to the movement of all particles in the simulation
