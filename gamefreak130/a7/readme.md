City Streets attempts to simulate a block of five buildings on a street. You can make the suburban dream, a row of skyscrapers, or something in between. If there is enough activity inside the buildings, you may even see some smoke rise from the chimneys.

To be honest, I was a little disappointed with how this turned out (and I really dislike the look of the gabled roof), since the buildings tend to feel a bit samey after a couple of iterations. Still, I suppose it could have been worse.

## Sliders

1. Height: How tall the building is
2. Roof Gabling: Controls the slope of the roof; zero is completely flat
3. Number of Windows: Controls the number of windows (1 to 5) on each story
4. Building Hue: The hue of the building's color
5. Building Lightness: The lightness of the building's color
6. Activity: How many people are currently occupying the building (represented as lit windows and chimney smoke)
