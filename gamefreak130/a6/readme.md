## Back to Normal?

This simulation was based on my experience interning at a large (50,000+ employee) company, where it seemed that working from home was frowned upon, if not explicitly forbidden. Given the current global pandemic, however, that policy has obviously shifted, to the point where even internships are being offered remotely, rather than canceling the on-site program. Now, with talk of plans to return to in-office work by the end of the year, the question remains: should remote work continue to be shunned, or has COVID proven it to be an acceptable way to do one's job? The simulation aims to look at some possible solutions by comparing health against productivity; after all, minor contagious diseases still exist in the world, and some tasks may not be conducive to a WFH environment.

Overall, I think this model was effective at proving that we should not simply ditch masks and WFH once herd immunity is reached, but there some weaknesses to the approach I took. For one, the simulation is programmed such that any healthy person can become ill even after they've already been sick, meaning potentially more infections at any given time then there would be in the real world. However, there are many different contagious illnesses, chronic conditions, or even major life events that workers in an office could experience, which might create a similar map of inhibited productivity. Additionally, in the final simulation, workers only decide to work remotely/take time off after they are already feeling sick. If WFH were truly normalized, and people decided to do it on a regular basis, then the observed productivity could be much lower. I would argue, though, that the productivity of these habitual remote workers would likely be closer to their in-office productivity, balancing out the equation more.
